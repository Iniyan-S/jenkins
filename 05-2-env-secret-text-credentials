// Secret Text Credentials

// The environment directive specifies a sequence of key-value pairs which will be defined as environment variables for all steps, or stage-specific steps, 
// depending on where the environment directive is located within the Pipeline.

// Environment directive supports a special helper method credentials() which can be used to access pre-defined Credentials by their identifier in the Jenkins environment.
// Credentials Type - Secret Text - the environment variable specified will be set to the Secret Text content.
