The post section defines one or more additional steps that are run upon the completion of a Pipeline's or stage's run (depending on the location of the post section within the Pipeline)
Post can support any of the following post-condition blocks: always, changed, fixed, regression, aborted, failure, success, unstable, unsuccessful, and cleanup.
