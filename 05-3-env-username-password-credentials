// Username and Password Credentials

// The environment directive specifies a sequence of key-value pairs which will be defined as environment variables for all steps, or stage-specific steps, 
// depending on where the environment directive is located within the Pipeline.

// Environment directive supports a special helper method credentials() which can be used to access pre-defined Credentials by their identifier in the Jenkins environment.

// Credential Type - Username and password - the environment variable specified will be set to username:password 
// and two additional environment variables will be automatically defined: MYVARNAME_USR and MYVARNAME_PSW respectively

// https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#environment
